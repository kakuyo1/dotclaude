$ARGUMENTS
Audit this doc for over-description. The reader is a capable agent that can reason from naming and read referenced code. Flag and propose to trim: rationale repeated >1×; rules / tag-sets / lists restated across sections; justifying parentheticals after self-evident statements; defensive prose against dead or hypothetical workflows; behavior the code self-documents; symbol explanations the naming makes obvious. Bias toward trimming — keep only what changes behavior or removes real ambiguity.

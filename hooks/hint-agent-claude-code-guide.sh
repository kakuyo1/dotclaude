# project-local <repo>/.claude/...), nudge it to consult the
# `claude-code-guide` subagent for current official docs BEFORE committing to
# a change. Scoped to settings.json / settings.local.json and the agents/,
# hooks/, skills/ subtrees — the schemas most likely to drift from training.
# Fires at most once per session_id to avoid re-prompting on iterative edits.
#
# Why: these schemas evolve quickly. Claude's training data lags the live
# docs, so editing them from prior knowledge often produces stale or invalid
# configurations. The claude-code-guide subagent fetches current Anthropic
# docs on demand.
